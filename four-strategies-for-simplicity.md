# Four Strategies for Simplicity

- **Remove**. Get rid of unnecessary elements until the product has only the essentials.
- **Organize**. Arrange the elements on the screen so that they make sense.
- **Hide**. Move any elements not essential for mainstream use so that they do not clutter the screen.
- **Displace**. Consider whether any elements or features can be handled offscreen, either in a different part of the site, on a different device, or by users themselves.
