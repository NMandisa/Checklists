# Designing Tables to be Read, Not Looked At

- Don't stretch tables
- Keep table furniture and fills to a minimum. Have the highest possible data-ink ratio.
	- Use alignment, spacing, and grouping.
	- Use borders and frames judiciously and preferably not at all.
		- If you have to use them, use them in one direction only and employ a lighter colour.
	- Avoid zebra striping, tints and fills, and any other backgrounds.
- Left-align text, right-align numbers, align headings with data.
- Align to the decimal point.
- Use tabular lining numerals in tables of numbers.
	- `table { font-variant-numeric: lining-nums tabular-nums; }`
- Put whitespace to work to group and separate.
- Add a table `<caption>`.
- Do not over-stylise tables.
